# krd48_project3
IOS project 3

I built on top of my project 2 for this project.

I used the class github account shared with the class in order to complete the mapkit/cloudkit requirements for the project. 
The source code was provied by Dr. Collard via github.

I also made a commit or two from a different laptop so my github name 
appears as someone elses, as I was signed into their github account.

Gestures that I created are pan and pinch to zoom.
